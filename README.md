# Secure Code Review Challenges

This repo contains the code for my Secure Code Review challenges. The idea is to look at basic web vulnerabilities in a language-agnostic way. 

If you like these challenges, you may want to check out my [LeoTrace Community](https://community.leo-trace.com/about-community). Sign-up is free and it allows you to collaborate with like-minded people, ask me any questions you may have, and much more!
